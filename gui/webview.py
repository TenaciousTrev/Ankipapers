    # Closing the window used to only clear the singleton. The QWebEngineView
    # was never torn down and the window stayed alive as a child of `mw`, so
    # the React app kept running after the window disappeared — including its
    # autosave timer, which held the document as it looked at close time and
    # kept writing that stale snapshot back to storage. Every open/close cycle
    # left another one of these behind, so a hidden, forgotten window could
    # silently overwrite work done in the current one.
    #
    # Now closing does two things, in order:
    #   1. waits for the page to finish writing (nothing recent is lost), then
    #   2. navigates the page to about:blank and deletes it, so no JavaScript
    #      — and no autosave timer — can outlive the window.
    #
    # Step 1 used to call window.ankiPapersFlush() and treat the callback as
    # "the save is done". It never was. runJavaScript() converts the script's
    # return value to a plain value, and the flush was an async function, so
    # what came back was a Promise — which converts to "finished, no result"
    # immediately. The callback therefore fired while the save had barely
    # started, the window closed, _teardown_webview() cut the bridge, and the
    # in-flight write was dropped. Save-then-Generate-then-close lost work for
    # exactly this reason: nothing ever waited for either operation.
    #
    # A Promise cannot be awaited from here, so the window asks instead of
    # waiting. It polls window.ankiPapersCloseState(), which returns a plain
    # string every time it is called ('saving', 'generating' or 'done'), and
    # closes only on 'done'. If the page is still busy after a few seconds it
